<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Definitely a crowd pleaser! It is really easy. I have done it with only the large package of vanilla pudding and also made it with one small package of vanilla and one small package of banana cream. There were no complaints either way from the diehard banana pudding fans in my circle of friends and family.After doing it a few times, I like to line dish with the nilla wafers and banana slices first and then mix up the filling. It seems to all go together faster that way. Maybe it's just in my head. LOL. And for those who like extra crunch, I always have more wafers available.Kudos! to this awesome, easy recipe that everyone I know is crazy about.</p>
